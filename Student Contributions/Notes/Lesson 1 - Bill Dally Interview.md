## Moore's Law

Misnomer story of being able to go to the store and buy a CPU that is faster b/c it has a faster clock.

Really its about the number of devices you can get on a chip, which is still alive and well (video is from 2015).

Around 2005, denard scaling stopped, scaling voltages as you scale dimensions that you make transistors at. Stopped b/c of leakage current. New generation of chip, get more transistors, energy goes down, 3x perf/watt improvement. Now we are getting a little energy gain since we hold voltage constant.

With CPUs today: frequency has flattened out, but you get parallelism.

## Design constraints

Energy efficiency is the #1 constraint. Then removing performance surprises (falling off performance cliff).

RTL simulations

## Advice

Memory is not flat, understand the memory hierarchy
